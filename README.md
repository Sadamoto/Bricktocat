## Parts and Colors

The slopes, plates and bricks used are cheap on second market like [Bricklink](https://www.bricklink.com/catalogTree.asp?itemType=P). If you need a part list, please get it from the stud.io file attached.

The plate in front is good to put on a printed label or something handwritten to personalize the set.

The colors of the cat itself are Lego® Black, Lego® Light Bluish Gray and Lego® Medium Azure.
The colors of the plate and the tile in front are interchangeable. In the instructions I chose Lego® Blue and Lego® Magenta.

The plate in front is good to put on a printed label or something handwritten to personalize the set.

## Possibilities

If you need the instructions in another form, you can design it yourself in the stud.io file. You can open it with [Bricklink Studio](https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page).
